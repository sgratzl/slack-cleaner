## Permission Scopes needed

The permissions to grant depend on what you are going to use the script for.
Grant the permissions below depending on your use.

Beyond granting permissions, if you wish to use this script to delete
messages or files posted by others, you will need to be an [Owner or
Admin](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218124397-Change-a-member-s-role)
of the workspace.

- `channels:history`
- `channels:read`
- `chat:write:user`
- `chat:write:bot`
- `users:read`

#### Deleting messages from private channels

- `groups:history`
- `groups:read`
- `chat:write:user`
- `users:read`

#### Deleting messages from 1:1 IMs

- `chat:write:user`
- `users:read`

#### Deleting messages from multi-person IMs

## Configuring app

The cleaner needs you to give Slack's API permission to let it run the
operations it needs. You grant these by registering it as an app in the
workspace you want to use it in.

You can grant these permissions to the app by:

1. going to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. select 'Create New App', fill out an App Name (eg 'Slack Cleaner') and
   select the Slack workspace you want to use it in
3. select 'OAuth & Permissions' in the sidebar
4. scroll down to Scopes and select all scopes you need
5. select 'Save changes'
6. select 'Install App to Workspace'
7. review the permissions and press 'Authorize'
8. copy the 'OAuth Access Token' shown, and use this token as the `--token`
   argument to the script

## Tips

After the task, a backup file `slack-cleaner.<timestamp>.log` will be created in current directory if `--log` is supplied.

If any API problem occurred, try `--rate=<delay-in-seconds>` to reduce the API call rate (which by default is unlimited).

If you see the following warning from `urllib3`, consider to install missing
packages: `pip install --upgrade requests[security]` or just upgrade your Python to 2.7.9.

```
InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available.
          This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail.
          For more information, see https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning.
